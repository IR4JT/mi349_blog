        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p>
         My name is Iraj Tambat. I am a student at Michigan State University with a passion for UI and UX. I grew up in Sterling Heights Michigan. Being in Michigan meant going to the Detroit auto show. Surprisingly, this is where I fell in love with UI and UX design. I saw many cars with different UI designs and how some were hard to understand. I wanted to make a UI where users are not overloaded with data but also looks cool. This is why I am studying at Michigan State University. I currently have a 3.806 GPA. Besides academics, I like coffee, walking, building legos, and finding solutions to complex things. I also love animals. Here is a picture of Max and I.
