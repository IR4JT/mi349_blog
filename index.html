        <h2>My Favorite Type Of Dogs</h2>

        <p>
          My favorite type of dogs are german shepherds. Only because I have one and he is the most adorable dog ever. A fun fact about him is was a puppy for the United States military but he failed some tests and we had the opportunity to pick him up. He was given a dog tag and we still have that on him. I will add a picture of him below. He is on a normal diet so he does not eat the normal dog food but rather my parents make him chicken and vegetables. Besides german shepherds my other favorite dog would have to be golden retrievers. They are also very adorable and I feel like I could hug them forever. I am in a club at Michigan State University called leader dogs for the blind. We train dogs for blind people and those dogs are mostly golden retrievers. They are like mini gentlemen to me. But besides that, those would be my top two favorite types of dogs. I honestly cannot think of more. My dog's name is Max. Oh another fact or silly thing is that he pulls me when biking but I go very fast since he runs so much.
