        <h2>My Favorite Type Of Dogs</h2>

        <p>
          My favorite type of dogs are german shepherds. Only because I have one and he is the most adorable dog ever. A fun fact about him is was a puppy for the United States military but he failed some tests and we had the opportunity to pick him up. He was given a dog tag and we still have that on him. I will add a picture of him below. He is on a normal diet so he does not eat the normal dog food but rather my parents make him chicken and vegetables. Besides german shepherds my other favorite dog would have to be golden retrievers. They are also very adorable and I feel like I could hug them forever. I am in a club at Michigan State University called leader dogs for the blind. We train dogs for blind people and those dogs are mostly golden retrievers. They are like mini gentlemen to me. But besides that, those would be my top two favorite types of dogs. I honestly cannot think of more. My dog's name is Max. Oh another fact or silly thing is that he pulls me when biking but I go very fast since he runs so much.

        <h2>Why I Like My Major</h2>

        <p>
          Why do I like my major? Well my major is information science at Michigan State University. I always loved being creative and in high school I took a couple of coding classes. This made me like designing a user interface but I also love researching. Researching and making an app better with that research is how I can make an impact on the world. I know it sounds silly but If I can make one person happy or make them satisfied that makes me smile. I love helping people. I also love art and drawing. My parents had me in drawing classes since I was little which I guess could translate to user interface designing as I am designing that. But not with pencils and brushes. Moreover, Michigan State University has a beautiful campus. It makes being on campus so much fun and also the professors are passionate about what they teach which makes me love going to all my courses. So why do I love my major then? I love it because I can indirectly make someone smile and make their day better with research. I also like being creative. I think that is probably the biggest part being creative but not for no reason.
